# AngularJS SPA Project
Single Page Application Project developed using AngularJS. In this project, I created a Todo Application and a Contact Form.


Here is a sample app written in AngularJS temporarily being hosted on AWS:  
<a href="http://angular-spa-project.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/" target="_blank">http://angular-spa-project.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/</a> 

### Home Page
##### Todo List Creator
- Enter and Add to Todo List
- Check off todo items when done with the check-box
- Drag list items to sort priority
- Delete items with the 'X' button   

> Your todo list is stored in local storage so refreshing or leaving the page wont clear them out. 


### Contact Page
##### Contact Form
- Validates only after first submit event
- If submit event triggered without passing validation, then it will show you which fields are and are not valid
- When submitted and verified, the form will hide and inform you that the form has been submitted and emailed

> **NOTE:** Actual email will not be sent. Email service yet to be connected.
